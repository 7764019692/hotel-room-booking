# Hotel Room Reservation System

## Problem Statement
A hotel has 97 rooms across 10 floors. The system optimally allocates rooms
based on minimum travel time while following booking constraints.

## Features
- Book up to 5 rooms at a time
- Same-floor priority booking
- Travel time calculation (horizontal + vertical)
- Visual room layout
- Random occupancy generation
- Reset booking

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How It Works
- Rooms are generated floor-wise
- Travel time is calculated using floor difference and room distance
- Booking logic prioritizes minimum travel time

## Live Demo
(Coming Soon)
